* What it is

A collection my config files for emacs and zsh. They seem to work fine under Mac OS and Arch Linux.

** Files and directories

| name          | what's in it                                                  |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| .emacs        | emacs config with lots of good stuff                          |
| .elips/*      | emacs script source files                                     |
| .zshrc        | zsh config with pretty colored prompt                         |
| zsh-scripts/* | three useful scripts for batch cloning, pulling and statusing |

** Installation

Move the files to ~/ and run the chsh command to set your shell to zsh. Start editing your favorite text files in emacs.

% chsh
