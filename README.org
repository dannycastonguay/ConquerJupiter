* What it is

A collection my config files for emacs and zsh. They seem to work fine under Mac OS and Arch Linux.

** Files and directories

| name          | what's in it                                                  |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| .emacs        | emacs config with lots of good stuff                          |
| .elips/*      | emacs script source files                                     |
| .zshrc        | zsh config with pretty colored prompt                         |
| zsh-scripts/* | three useful scripts for batch cloning, pulling and statusing |

Note: the zsh-scripts are specific to antportal, but you can certainly figure out how to adapt to your needs.

** Installation

Move the files to ~/ and run the chsh command to set your shell to zsh. Start editing your favorite text files in emacs. Alternatively, if you are already using zsh, you can use installCJ which will do all that.

% chsh
